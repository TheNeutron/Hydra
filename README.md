#Hydra

 Hydra is a proxy system that utilizes and takes advantage of docker. 
 Hydra uses AWS’s EC2 in order to create containers which will run shadow socks(still determining whether or not I will) and after a certain period of time, 
 it’ll delete the container and recreate it rinse and repeat. 
 The purpose of this project is to prioritize the most versatile option for web-scraping as it’ll prevent blacklisting, 
 and offer some of the smoothest browsing experience one could have.
